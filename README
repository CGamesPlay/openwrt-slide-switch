# slide-switch

slide-switch translates slide switch position changes into normal button
presses and releases for OpenWrt / LEDE devices.

## Usage

After installing slide-switch, follow the instructions at the [OpenWrt
wiki][button howto] to add scripts for each switch position. Both procd
scripts (in `/etc/rc.button`) and hotplug scripts (in
`/etc/hotplug.d/button`) are supported.

Each switch position has a corresponding button name in the form
`<switch name>-<switch position>`. For example, the TP-Link TL-MR3020
has a switch named "mode" with positions "3g", "wisp" and "ap", so the
button names for each switch position are `mode-3g`, `mode-wisp` and
`mode-ap`. See [Supported Devices](#supported-devices) for a list of
switch names and positions.

slide-switch will trigger both button presses and releases. For example,
if the "mode" switch on the TP-Link TL-MR3020 is moved from "3g" to
"wisp", a release action (`ACTION=released`) will be triggered for the
`mode-3g` "button", and a press action (`ACTION=pressed`) will be
triggered for the `mode-wisp` "button". (For both actions, a `SEEN`
variable will also be set to the number of seconds since a previous
action occurred for that button.) Note that timeout action is not
supported at this time.

## Supported Platforms

slide-switch has been tested with OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 and should
work with current OpenWrt / LEDE development snapshots.

Data for these devices was initially collected from the OpenWrt wiki and
from OpenWrt / LEDE source code. Devices where the switch data has been
verified correct is noted in the Verified column.
